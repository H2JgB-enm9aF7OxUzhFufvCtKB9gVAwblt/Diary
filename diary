Learning ssh.


Create list function and elist alias for my everything notes.
list () {
	echo "$*" >> ~/directories/list
}
alias elist='e ~/directories/list'   # I set 'vim' 'e' for shell.


Creating Now function.
Part of sample:
while true; do cat ~/directories/now.list | aosd_cat --position 4 --x-offset -50 --y-offset 00 --shadow-offset 0 --transparency 0 --font 'Droid Sans Mono 33' --back-opacity 255 --back-color white --fore-color black --shadow-color white --fore-opacity 255 --fade-in 0 --fade-full 3000 --fade-out 0 ; done

I read about ssh-agent, ssh-add, keychain, etc. I think about what way I do for authentification.

Play with Github, push, fetch, merge, and pull.
I learned there are https authentification and ssh authentification.
I create some repository from github and clone it. Then, I experiment between the cloned local repository and the github repository.

HTTPS
Github set the default clone url to https so I experienced https first. Https authentification is simple than I thought. I encounter prompt for inputting userID and password in the experiment, push phase, and authentification is done.
If I don't want to enter these repeatedly, I can use .netrc (with gpg) or GNOME Keyring or credential.helper[1] (cache or store). The first one is hyper simple but insecure if it is without encryption. Actually, I first tried plain ~/.netrc and enjoyed interaction with Github.
