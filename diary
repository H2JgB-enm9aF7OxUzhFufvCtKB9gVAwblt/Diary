Play with Github, push, fetch, merge, and pull.
I learned there are https authentification and ssh authentification.
I create some repository from github and clone it. Then, I experiment between the cloned local repository and the github repository.

HTTPS
Github set the default clone url to https so I experienced https first. Https authentification is simple than I thought. I encounter prompt for inputting userID and password in the experiment, push phase, and authentification is done.
If I don't want to enter these repeatedly, I can use .netrc (with gpg) or GNOME Keyring or credential.helper[1] (cache or store). The first one is hyper simple but insecure if it is without encryption. Actually, I first tried plain ~/.netrc and enjoyed interaction with Github.
