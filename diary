Work on at command.

Nicely did my morning jobs because I set the at job yesterday, which just show a image of sunrise at the time of sunrise.
The sunrise image resized by xloadimage's dump option but I can also use gimp as always. I also set sunset by at, but I made mistake setting the image of sunrise, ha ha.

Learned how to look inside at jobs.
at -c job [job...]

Create forever function.
forever() { while true; do $* ; done }

Create show_now.
show_now() { cat ~/directories/now.page | aosd_cat --position 4 --x-offset -50 --y-offset 00 --shadow-offset 0 --transparency 0 --font 'Droid Sans Mono 33' --back-opacity 255 --back-color white --fore-color black --shadow-color white --fore-opacity 255 --fade-in 0 --fade-full 3000 --fade-out 0 }

Install xloadimage.

Experiment with at command for showing just fullscreen image (works!).

Learned these are ok.
⌨  echo 'DISPLAY=:0.0 xmessage hi' | at now
⌨  echo 'export DISPLAY=:0.0 ; xmessage hi' | at now
⌨  echo 'xmessage -display :0.0 hi' | at now                              

While these are not ok.
⌨  echo 'DISPLAY=:0.0 ; xmessage hi' | at now
⌨  echo 'export DISPLAY=:0.0 xmessage hi' | at now 

GUI/X program(xmessage, xloadimage, eog, Firefox, etc.) needs DISPLAY environmental varible to be set.
From man at,
>>The working directory, the environment (except for the variables BASH_VERSINFO, DISPLAY, EUID, GROUPS,  SHELLOPTS, TERM, UID, and _) and the umask are retained from the time of invocation.
>>As at is currently implemented as a setuid program, other environment variables (e.g.  LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD) are also not exported.  This may change in the future.  As a workaround, set these variables explicitly in your job.

Learning ssh.


Create list function and elist alias for my everything notes.
list () {
	echo "$*" >> ~/directories/list
}
alias elist='e ~/directories/list'   # I set 'vim' 'e' for shell.


Creating Now function.
Part of sample:
while true; do cat ~/directories/now.list | aosd_cat --position 4 --x-offset -50 --y-offset 00 --shadow-offset 0 --transparency 0 --font 'Droid Sans Mono 33' --back-opacity 255 --back-color white --fore-color black --shadow-color white --fore-opacity 255 --fade-in 0 --fade-full 3000 --fade-out 0 ; done

I read about ssh-agent, ssh-add, keychain, etc. I think about what way I do for authentification.



2015-11-21
Play with Github, push, fetch, merge, and pull.
I learned there are https authentification and ssh authentification.
I create some repository from github and clone it. Then, I experiment between the cloned local repository and the github repository.

HTTPS
Github set the default clone url to https so I experienced https first. Https authentification is simple than I thought. I encounter prompt for inputting userID and password in the experiment, push phase, and authentification is done.
If I don't want to enter these repeatedly, I can use .netrc (with gpg) or GNOME Keyring or credential.helper[1] (cache or store). The first one is hyper simple but insecure if it is without encryption. Actually, I first tried plain ~/.netrc and enjoyed interaction with Github.
